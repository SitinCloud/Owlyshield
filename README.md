## Owlyshield

Owlyshield is an open-source AI-driven antivirus engine written in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org). It is particularly efficient against ransomwares.

### How does it work?

1. A minifilter (a file system filter driver) intercepts I/O request packets (IRPs) to collect metadata about what happens on the disks (*DriverMsg* in the sources),
2. *Owlyshield-predict* uses the previously created *DriverMsgs* to compute features submitted to a RNN (a special type of neural network wich works on sequences). Behavioural as well as static analysis are performed.
3. If the RNN predicts a malware, *owlyshield-predict* asks the minifilter to kill the malicious processes and send a very detailed report about what happened to your SIEM tools (and/or a local file).

### How was the model trained?

The model was trained with malwares from the real world collected from very diverse places on the internet (dark web, by sharing with researchers, analysis of thousands of downloads with virustotal).

We ran them on Windows VMs with owlyshield working in a specific mode (`--features record`) to save the IRPs. *Owlyshield-predict* with `--features replay` was then used to write the learning dataset (a csv file).

The [malwares-ml](https://github.com/SitinCloud/malwares-ml) repository is the place where we share some of our learning datasets.

### Open-source philosophy

We at [SitinCloud ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·](https://github.com/SitinCloud) strongly believe that cybersecurity products should always be open-source. 
1. In addition to the source code, we provide a complete wiki and code documentation,
2. Open-source products can be considered as sovereign solutions because there is no risk of any foreign agency introducing hidden backdoor or mass surveillance features users may not be aware of.
3. We provide specific entrypoints in the code to make interfacing with third-party tools easy (specifically SIEM and EDRs).


### Free vs Pro editions

The Free Edition (community edition) is fully operational and will efficiently protect your system against ransomwares. You don't need anymore to start Windows in test-signing mode since we now provide the signed driver in the community version.

The Pro Edition (commercial edition) adds the following features:
* A webapp gathering all incidents data to help IT staff to understand the scope of the attack within the company networks and act accordingly (or classify it as a false positive),
* Interfaces with your log management tools (we even provide an API),
* Scheduled tasks to auto-update the application.

Within the frame of the free version usage we will do our best to help you finding a solution for any issue you may rise in the GitHub issue management system (https://github.com/SitinCloud/Owlyshield/issues).
However we cannot guarantee that we will do it in an immediate nor quick way.

Issues that subscribers to our commercial version or valued added reseelers may rise will of course be handled in priority.

### Business model

Although commercial products or services can be directly purchased from us (feel free to contact us directly for any quotation that could suit your need), we think that our products should be distributed to end customer in an indirect way.

So if you want to become a distribution partner or use our products as an MSSP please contact us since we are opened to such kind of partnerhips.

If you want to integrate Owlyshield as part of your own EDR / XDR system please contact us we will be pleased to issue the best proposal for appropriate level of professional services to do so. 

If you need to protect your critical enterprise servers against crafted attacks or progressive wipers, we can introduce you with our brand new novelty detection engine based on encoders AI tools (Owlyshield Enterprise Edition). Feel free to contact us for a presentation and a demo.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites for building from the source code

1. Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170) packages
2. [Disable "Driver Signature Enforcement"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/test-signing) at Windows startup. This is only required if you did not [get a copy](mailto:register@sitincloud) of the driver signed by Microsoft for [SitinCloud](https://wwww.sitincloud.com) (we provide it for free if you are a contributor).


### Installation

We regularly release installers (in the *Releases* GitHub section). You may need to enable the driver signin mode (the Signed Driver is part of the commercial version) as explained in *Prequisites*.

Please refer to the Wiki if you prefer to build it yourself.

Suggestions are welcome (see *Contributing*).

See the open issues for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).

## Contributing

We help our contributors by providing them with:
- A copy of the driver signed by Microsoft,
- A free access to Owlyshield Pro Edition.

If you have a suggestion that would make this better, please fork the repo and create a pull request. You can also simply open an issue with the tag "enhancement".
Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. Fork the Project
2. Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some AmazingFeature'`)
4. Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
